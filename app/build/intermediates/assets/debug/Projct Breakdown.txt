started with a basic AutoCompleteTextView project

implemented alphabetical suggestions via a dropdown list

the suggestions would originally only work for the first word typed

found a custom tokens that split up the text and allowed alphabetical suggestions
for subsequent words

then i worked on providing suggestions based on the users input, with suggestions sorted via frequency of use e.g.. the 3 most popular words containing text the user is typing is returned

then added a list to hold user text history. when user types, and hits send the current text is added to a list on screen, so user can see previous entries

this text is also added to a text file on the SDcard. this text file is used to generate suggestions for word completion.

added text to display number of matched entries in the dictionary, based on current user text

added toms code to the app, where, when typing, auto completion words will be suggested, then when space is entered toms sentence completion words are suggested

the word completion and sentence completion words appear on the same buttons.

then implemented persistence. the current text file used for word completion is saved to disc whenever the send button is pressed

this file is loaded from SD card when the app loads first
